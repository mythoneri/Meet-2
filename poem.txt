Lost Inside My Mind & Thoughts

My mind always wanders, lost in a haze,
Daydreaming frequently, in a blissful maze.
I am getting older, time slips away,
Will be alone eventually, come what may.

Daydreams paint pictures, vivid and bright,
Of worlds unknown, filled with wonder and light.
A solace I seek, a peaceful retreat,
From the noise of the world, a quiet retreat.

But loneliness creeps in, a shadow at dusk,
Whispering softly, its touch like rust.
In the midst of the dreams, the silence is deep,
A longing for connection, a place to keep.

A man's heart yearns for love, pure and true,
A bond that's unbroken, forever new.
To feel cherished and valued, a tender embrace,
A love that endures, time and space.

A gentle touch, a knowing glance,
A shared laughter, a loving chance.
To build a life together, side by side,
A love story written, a future's tide.
